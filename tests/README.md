# Site Reviews Tests

Use [wordpress-versions](https://github.com/pryley/wordpress-versions) to install the WordPress test-suite and run the unit-tests locally.

- End-to-End Tests are run after loading a WordPress environment.
- Unit Tests are run in isolation without loading a WordPress environment, they assume all other code (e.g. WordPress) is working perfectly.
